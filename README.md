# The task:
Use NASA dataset for meteor landing https://data.nasa.gov/resource/y77d-th95.json

Build a simple app that helps our user to complete the following flow

1. The user can start the investigation by YEAR
2. The user will see the total amount of meteors landed at that time frame (visualize it in any way you'd like, or just simple text - your call)
3. The user can now filter by larger then MASS in a free text - 
if a meteor in this mass size was not found then the filter resets the year to a year where there is a meteor that fits the query
"The user should see a message saying - mass was not found, jumping to first-year where there is a mass that fits the criteria)

**Example:** \
The user selects 1984 in the year box -> \
The page shows 7 meteors ->  \
the user filters by 1000 mass -> \
the page shows 4 meteors -> \
the user filters by 100000 -> \
the view jumps to year 1952 and shows 1 meteor
